<h2><span class="small">PREFACE</span></h2>
<p>This publication is a guide to the armor and arms in the City Art
Museum of St. Louis and, incidentally, a very elementary introduction
to the history of arms and armor in general. The major part of the Museum&rsquo;s
collection, comprising the European armor and arms of the fifteenth,
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, is displayed in a single armor gallery.
Other specimens are shown with the exhibition of their own special cultures.</p>
<p>The City Art Museum is, as its name implies, restricted to objects of
art, to objects which, independently of their usefulness, are more or less
beautiful by the intention of their makers. There are numerous items in
the vast range of armor and arms which do not fill this requirement, and
are purely utilitarian. The Museum possesses specimens of some of these.
As they are not considered objects of art they are not on exhibition, but
have been assembled in a special study collection where they can be seen
on application to the Curator.</p>
<p>When individual specimens are illustrated, they are given, in the list
of illustrations, their identifying Museum serial numbers. If a reader fails
to find on exhibition any such specimen in which he is interested, he has
only to ask for it by this serial number at the information desk. If its place

reason it has been temporarily removed from exhibition, arrangements

<p>The subject of armor and arms is neither short nor simple, and it is
quite impossible, in a publication the size of this one, to do more than give
the barest kind of outline. Many points of interest are not discussed in
detail, some technical terms are unexplained, many fascinating items are
not mentioned at all. If the subject interests you, you will find helpful
information in the books listed on page 43, most of which will be available
at any public library. If specific questions concerning armor and arms are
addressed to the Curator, City Art Museum, Forest Park, St. Louis 5,
Missouri, accompanied by a self-addressed, stamped envelope, they will be
answered as far as practicable, but research problems cannot be undertaken.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">THE EARLIEST ARMOR AND ARMS</span></h2>
<p>Once upon a time there probably were men who had neither armor
nor arms. They did not last long, for wild animals or other men with stones
or sticks in their hands killed them and ate them up. The first men about
whom we know anything definite already had weapons of stone. Arms and,
later, armor have accompanied man throughout his history.</p>
<p>The first obvious weapons were stones, roughly shaped to make them
more effective. Such are not to be found in the City Art Museum, but we
do have examples of the next type to develop, the weapons of the bronze age.</p>
<p>Bronze is a mixture of copper and tin, and it was invented a very long
time ago, and in many different places. It was known in ancient Egypt, in
the Far East and in Europe. Two thousand years before Christ the Chinese
were making bronze arms and domestic and ceremonial objects of all sorts,
and were making them so beautiful that such objects are considered proper
exhibits for an art museum. We have a very fine collection of ancient
Chinese bronzes, exhibited in the Museum&rsquo;s Chinese galleries, and among
them are numerous weapons. The earliest include axes and dagger-axes
(<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>). These date from the Shang Dynasty, (ca. 1523-ca. 1028 B.C.) This
too is the period of a bronze helmet (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>) in the form of a hood with
smooth sides which come down well over the cheeks, while leaving the
front of the face exposed. Helmets of almost precisely this form, but made
of steel, were worn in Italy in the fifteenth century, more than two thousand
years later! This helmet has a small plume-holder at its very top, and
is peculiar in having, as its only decoration, a pair of eyes embossed in
relief on the forehead.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig1">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="447" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Fig. 1. A Chinese bronze axe more than 3000 years
old, with a crouching monster in relief.</i></p>
</div>
<p>From the Ordos region of Siberia, where a primitive culture lasted for
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
a very long time, comes a particularly fine ceremonial dagger (<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>) of
bronze with inlays of turquoise. From China again, dating throughout the
thousand years before Christ, come numerous bronze weapons now in the
Museum&rsquo;s Study Collection, including swords, daggers, and, from about
the beginning of the Christian Era, most ingenious mechanisms for the
crossbow (<a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>) a weapon which was not known in Europe until many
centuries later.</p>
<p>An Etruscan grave has yielded the large bronze disk of <a href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>. On stylistic
grounds it is believed that this originated not in Etruria, but on the
other, Eastern, shore of Italy in Picenum, in the second half of the seventh
century before Christ. It was probably the central reinforcement of a large
leather shield.</p>

</div>
<p>But of all the specimens of antique armor and arms in this (and possibly
in any other) museum, none surpasses the helmet shown in our <a href="#imgx1">frontispiece</a>.
This helmet, together with fragments of armor, a shield rim and a
spear point, all now in the Museum, was found in a tomb near Metaponto,
in Southern Italy, where once there was a Greek colony. It is believed to
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
date from about the middle of the sixth century B.C. The helmet is of
bronze, the upper part of the bowl formed as the neck and head of a ram.
This is surmounted by a great crest of silver, resting on a support of ivory.
The cheek pieces of the helmet have rams&rsquo; heads in profile embossed in
relief. The eyes, the horns of the main ram&rsquo;s head, the ivory crest holder
and part of the silver crest are restorations, but enough original fragments
of the crest were found with the helmet to indicate exactly how the crest
was shaped. Moreover the existence of such metallic crests is verified by a
bronze statuette of similar origin (<a href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a>).</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p04b.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="600" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Fig. 4. A crossbow lock two thousand years old, with a
model to show how the parts interlock. An ingenious bit of early mechanical engineering.</i></p>
</div>
<p>At first glance, the helmet proclaims itself a great work of sculpture,
and proves that arms and armor can properly belong in a museum of art.
How very well this piece deserves its place here is still more apparent on
close examination. It seems incredible that so long ago a craftsman could,
without any of our modern tools, have formed from a single plate of bronze
such a deep and difficult forging as this helmet bowl. It is equally amazing
that, in a period still considered as archaic, his artistic imagination could
have produced so naturalistic yet so noble a rendition of an animal form.
The technical skill and taste of the engraving and embossing are also noteworthy:
the suggestion of locks of hair around the forehead, the eyebrows
which terminate as snakes&rsquo; heads, the suggestions of skin texture on the
rams&rsquo; heads. It is indeed one of the world&rsquo;s masterpieces of armor.</p>
<p>Although the Greeks made their armor out of bronze, they did have
knowledge of iron, at least as early as the fifth century B.C. But it was
extremely difficult for them to prepare, as they had not yet discovered
efficient methods of smelting it from iron ore, so that what little they had
was very precious. It could not be spared for making armor, but was
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
restricted to edged weapons where a relatively small amount of this hard
new metal could be most effective. The Romans too used iron, and as their
technical skill improved they used more and more of it.</p>
<p>After the Roman empire was overwhelmed by the barbarian hordes from
the North the making of fine arms languished. It did not cease; occasionally
discoveries are made of beautifully inlaid sword pommels and shield bosses
belonging to the so-called &ldquo;dark ages&rdquo;. Sword blades too turn up occasionally,
skillfully constructed of many layers of alternately hard steel and soft
iron, so that they may retain a keen cutting edge yet still be tough rather
than brittle.</p>

<p>(Steel, you will remember, is not a separate metal; it is just iron which
contains from about .5% to about 2.5%, of carbon. This gives it the peculiar
property that if it is heated to redness and quickly cooled, it becomes much
harder than before. It also becomes more brittle. If hardened steel be
heated a second time, not red hot but to a much lower temperature, and
again chilled, the hardness is reduced somewhat, while the brittleness is
reduced a great deal; the metal becomes tough and suitable for making
into tools. This second heating and chilling is called &ldquo;tempering&rdquo;. Contrary
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
to popular belief, &ldquo;to temper&rdquo; steel does not mean &ldquo;to make it harder&rdquo;. It
means &ldquo;to make fully hardened steel somewhat softer and much tougher&rdquo;.
If the iron has too much or too little carbon it cannot be hardened at all;
if there is too little it is very soft and malleable and is called &ldquo;wrought
iron&rdquo;. If there is too much carbon it is harder than mild steel, but is very
brittle indeed; this is called &ldquo;cast iron&rdquo;.)</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAIN MAIL</span></h2>
<p>Except for the rare finds just mentioned, we know little about the armor
and arms of the period from the fall of Rome to about the twelfth century.
The paintings, drawings, and statues which have survived suggest, but
give no clear information. We have reason to believe that armor was made
of small plates of iron attached to cloth or leather garments, or of chain
mail, a fabric made of interlinked rings of iron wire. Towards the end of
this period we know that chain mail was extensively employed, for it often
appears, especially in England, on the engraved brass plates attached to
the tombs of important people of the time (<a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a>). The Museum has a small
collection of paper impressions of these &ldquo;brasses&rdquo; which are well worthy
of study by anyone interested in early armor. Some are exhibited on the
walls of the armor gallery.</p>
<p>Chain mail is more interesting than it appears at first glance, and the
Museum&rsquo;s specimens deserve to be looked at carefully. In the first place,
it was made of wire. Nowadays wire is so common that we think nothing
of it; it is produced by the mile with automatic machinery. But in medieval
times wire was scarce and valuable, for every bit of it had to be made by
hand. At first this was done with the hammer: a billet of iron was pounded
with a hammer held in one hand, while the other kept the billet rotating so
that its diameter became less and less until it was small enough to be made
up into links of mail. Of course, only short bits of wire could be made in
this way and the diameter was naturally irregular. It was slow and tedious
work, but the earliest mail was so made. Later it was found that a rod of
iron could be pulled by tongs through a hole in a hardened steel plate,
thus reducing its diameter and giving it a uniform thickness. By drawing
it through a number of holes of progressively smaller diameter, the wire
could be made quite thin and entirely uniform. Then such wire could be
wound in a coil around an iron rod, and the coil then cut lengthwise with
a chisel or saw giving a large number of links all of the same size. All later
chain mail was so made. Such links were interlaced, each link with four
others, to form a fabric much like that of a lady&rsquo;s mesh bag. However, if
the ends of the links were simply brought together the fabric would not
be very strong. An arrow or dagger point could easily spread open a link,
and penetrate to the wearer&rsquo;s body. So all good chain mail was strengthened
by having the ends of every link overlapped, slightly flattened, and then
riveted. In that part of the world we now call &ldquo;Middle East&rdquo;&mdash;where the
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
Mohammedan and Hindu cultures flourished&mdash;the rivet was a separate
piece of fine wire. European chain mail is more of a mystery&mdash;principally
because there is so very little old European chain mail still in existence.
The probability is that a separate rivet was used as in the Eastern mail, but
that its insertion was more skillfully performed. However, some scholars
feel that European chain mail was welded or was riveted by a swaging
process, that a special tool in the form of tongs or a pair of dies forced a
small part of the lower end of the link of chain mail through a slit in the
upper end and then riveted it over. Careful microscopical research on
sections of links of mail could doubtless solve this problems, but who
wants to cut off links from a rare and precious genuine, documented piece?
As yet it may be said that no such ingenious swaging tool has been discovered,
nor have we any unquestionably contemporary illustrations which
would prove this theory.</p>
<p>In places where special strength was required, as around the throat, the
rings were made of the same size but of heavier wire, which was flattened
by hammering in the neighborhood of the rivet. In this way the overlapping
of the rings became so close that not even a needle could penetrate the
fabric (<a href="#fig8">Fig. 8</a>). In other cases, unflattened rings were used, but strands of
leather were drawn through the rows, giving additional rigidity and protection.
It is believed that this practice accounts for the appearance of
what is known as &ldquo;banded mail&rdquo; in numerous monuments and engraved
brasses.</p>
<p>Chain mail was a good protection against cuts and stabs, but it had a
number of serious disadvantages. In the first place, it was expensive. Even
the most skillful armorer could make it but slowly. The mail cape of <a href="#fig8">Fig. 8</a>
contains about 44,235 links, each separately forged and riveted; some
complete coats of mail contain over 200,000! Forgeries of antique chain
mail are practically non-existent, for they would cost more to make than
genuine specimens, rare as they are, would be worth today.</p>
<p>Again, chain mail was very easily attacked by rust, and, once it was
rusted, was most difficult to clean. (The usual way was to put a rusted
mail shirt in a barrel with some oily sawdust and to set an apprentice to
rolling the barrel around for hour after hour.) Consequently very little
early mail is left&mdash;most of it just rusted away to nothing. It was heavy
and uncomfortable, for the whole weight hung from the shoulders.</p>
<p>But its worst disadvantage lay in its flexibility. It would resist a cut,
but was of little protection against a blow. To make it of any use in battle
against heavy swords, maces, and battle axes it was necessary to wear
beneath it a very heavily padded garment which, of course, was hot. How
the Crusaders in their chain mail must have sweated in the hot sun of the
Holy Land! And how many mail-clad knights must have been pounded to
death without necessarily losing one drop of blood!</p>

<p>To protect against blows, therefore, it became necessary to produce a
rigid protection. The primitive state of iron metallurgy did not permit the
making of more than small pieces of iron at a time. Nevertheless, iron head
coverings were already in use by the eleventh century, and from that time
on pieces of plate armor increased in size and number. After the head
defense, the most vulnerable part of a rider&rsquo;s body (for remember that
only knights could afford mail, and knights fought on horseback) was the
knees. Have you ever had a really hard bump on the kneecap, and, if you
remember one, should you have liked to go on fighting just after receiving
it? The knight represented in the brass of <a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a>, who died in 1289, wears
knee-guards, and rests his head on his great &ldquo;pot-helm&rdquo;, which was normally
attached to his body by a chain, so that it could not easily be lost if he
took it off to get a breath of air. The City Art Museum has no specimens
of plate armor of this early period.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Fig. 9. A helmet called a salade: made like a deep

</div>
<p>During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries it became the fashion
to wear a long cloth garment, called a <i>surcoat</i>, over armor. Pictures and
statues of this period show armored figures only with such surcoats, and
it is, therefore, impracticable to follow the exact development of the pieces
of plate armor which were added to reinforce the chain mail. By the beginning
of the fifteenth century complete outfits of plate armor were in use,
but the earliest surviving suits of the so-called &ldquo;Gothic&rdquo; armor date from
about 1460. They are exceedingly rare. The City Art Museum possesses
only a gauntlet of about 1450 and a helmet (<a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a>) from about 1475, yet
we feel lucky to have these two pieces, for &ldquo;Gothic&rdquo; armor is not only rare:
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
it is very beautiful. It was at this period that armorers did their best work,
from every standpoint. It was best metallurgically, with inner surfaces of
pure soft iron, but with outer surfaces skillfully converted into almost
glass-hard steel. It was best functionally, for its simple clean curved lines
were admirably designed to turn a blow harmlessly aside, with no unnecessary
decorative forms to catch descending edge or point. It was best artistically
(as is usually the case with things that function perfectly), depending
for beauty on its own pure sculptural lines rather than on extraneous
ornament.</p>
<p>The helmet of <a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a> is of a type called <i>salade</i>. It is a simple steel hat, like
that of a modern soldier, and originally had a padded lining. Unlike the
modern military helmet, however, it covers the head down to the end of the
nose; there is a narrow slit in front of the eyes which permits surprisingly
good vision while leaving the eyes quite well protected. The lines of this
helmet are clean and elegant, typical of the &ldquo;Gothic&rdquo; style. This type of
helmet was often worn in combination with an upstanding guard for the
lower part of the face which was attached to the top of the neck-defense.
The lower edge of the helmet overlapped the upper edge of this face-guard;
thus the entire face was protected, yet the wearer had reasonable ventilation
and could obtain more when circumstances permitted by taking off
his helmet.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">&ldquo;MAXIMILIAN&rdquo; ARMOR</span></h2>
<p>At the beginning of the sixteenth century the most important single
personality in Europe was probably King (later Emperor) Maximilian I
of Germany and Austria. A contemporary of Leonardo da Vinci, he lived
at a time when versatility was one of the characteristics of an educated
man, and as sovereign he set his subjects a good example in this respect.
He wrote books on genealogy, hunting and woodsmanship, horse breeding,
architecture, and landscape gardening. He was greatly interested in arms
and armor, and frequently visited his court armorer in his workshop. It is
not surprising, therefore, that he had a great influence on the design of
armor, and that the new and sharply different fashion which appeared at
this time became known as the &ldquo;Maximilian&rdquo;. It was characterized by
parallel, or almost parallel, fluting, especially on breastplate and thigh guards,
by broad-toed foot guards (<i>sollerets</i>) as compared with the long
pointed toes of the Gothic period, and by strongly roped edges of the
plates. The City Art Museum has an excellent suit of Maximilian armor
(<a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>). The breastplate, thigh guards (<i>tassets</i>) and main shell of the
helmet illustrate the characteristic flutings, while the sollerets are fully
developed Maximilian style. The suit was made in Nuremberg in the first
quarter of the sixteenth century, and was formerly in the armory of Prince
Liechtenstein.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">ARMOR OF THE LATE XVI CENTURY: DECORATED ARMOR</span></h2>
<p>By the middle of the sixteenth century the techniques of the armorer
were fully developed. From the smelters he was able to obtain iron in
good-sized lumps, and he had learned so to weld it as to produce plates of
any desired size. He could keep it soft and malleable or could add minute
amounts of carbon and thus convert it into steel, which he could, by heat
treatment, give any desired degree of hardness. He no longer bothered to
harden the surface of his breastplate and helmets to the glassy hardness
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
which was the pride of the Gothic armorers, but he made good, reasonably
homogeneous mild steel which was hard enough for sword or dagger blades,
yet tough enough to avoid brittleness. He could hammer his metal into
even the most fantastic shapes, could color or gild it, or could inlay it with
precious metals. Armorers began to vie with one another to produce magnificent
and elaborate armor; many and strange were the results. Instead
of only one kind of armor, as in the past, there were three: military, tournament
and parade armor.</p>
<p>In the military armor, intended for actual fighting, taste was usually
conservative. Extravagances, such as excessively wide or narrow sollerets,
over-elaborate elbow guards, or extremely large shoulder guards, were
avoided. A moderate amount of decoration was considered quite permissible,
provided it did not lessen the functionality of the armor; such decoration
most frequently was in the form of etching.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">

<p class="pcap"><i>Fig. 12. A morion with etched decoration.
Handsome, but rather top-heavy.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Although we are accustomed to think of etching primarily in connection
with pictures on paper, the process seems to have originated with the
armorers. They would take a helmet or breastplate, paint it all over with
a heavy acid-proof varnish, scratch a design through this varnish with a
sharp needle, then place the metal in a bath of acid. The acid would eat
away the steel where the varnish had been scratched, but not elsewhere.
After the plate had been taken from the acid and the varnish removed, the
etched part would show dark against the polished surface of the steel. This
contrast could be heightened by rubbing in a little black pigment, and the
early armorers discovered that they could readily keep a record of their
work or a sample sheet to show other customers, by simply placing a piece
of paper against the etched and blackened surface and rubbing it. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
fresh black would stick to the paper, giving a clear impression of the
etched design. Masters of etching like Rembrandt used and modern etchers
still use essentially the same process.</p>

</div>
<p>The Museum has a number of good examples of etched armor. In <a href="#fig11">Fig. 11</a>
we see a breastplate with etched designs of military trophies and mythological
figures. <a href="#fig12">Fig. 12</a> shows a helmet, formerly in the collections of the
Baron de Cosson and Henry G. Keasbey, of the type called <i>morion</i>, with
an exceedingly high comb and similar etched decoration. <a href="#fig13">Fig. 13</a> shows a
typical <i>closed helmet</i> of the mid-sixteenth century. Like the morion, it has
a high, elaborately etched comb. The wearer&rsquo;s face was protected by two
plates, an upper one called the <i>vizor</i>, which has a narrow horizontal slit for
vision like the salade described on <a href="#Page_9">page 9</a>, and a lower called the <i>ventail</i>
which has holes and vertical slits for ventilation. Both are pivoted at the
ears, so that the vizor could be raised alone or vizor and ventail together,
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
yet at the appearance of danger both could be snapped down into position
with a single sweep of the gauntleted hand. The etching on this helmet
shows floral arabesques and leaping stags against a background, not blackened,
but gilt. Such gilding was done by rubbing the freshly etched surface
with a mixture of gold and mercury, then heating the metal to evaporate
the mercury and leave behind the gold firmly attached to the steel.</p>

</div>
<p>Tournament armor, used in the toughest, most exciting sport that man
has ever invented, was worn for comparatively short periods of time, and
could, therefore, be considerably heavier than the military armor which
a man might have to wear continuously. Decoration on the armor itself
was reduced to a minimum, although elaborate trappings of cloth and
feathers were often added to it. <a href="#fig14">Fig. 14</a> shows a helmet for use in a form
of tournament conducted according to Italian rules, in which the contestants
were separated by a fence which prevented their horses from
colliding, thus permitting unrestricted speed of attack. The helmet is very
solid and sturdy, with plain polished surfaces to deflect the opposing
lance-point. Notice the circular hollow rim at the neck. This closed over
an outward-turned rim on the throat defense (<i>colletin</i>) so that although
the helmet could be turned to either side following the motion of the
wearer&rsquo;s head, it could not separate from the body armor at the throat and
leave an opening for hostile spear or
sword point.</p>

<p>Parade armor was the lightest
yet the most elaborate of all. Not intended
for actual combat in either
war or sport, it did not require the
fundamental functionality of the
other types; the armorers were free
to follow their fancy and make the
decoration as elaborate as they
pleased. All methods were used.
Etching and gilding were extensive
and in addition the metal was embossed
or chased in the most fanciful
forms. In addition to the flat mercury
gilding, gold was applied by
the <i>damascene</i> process, either the
&ldquo;true&rdquo; damascene in which plates
or wires of gold (or silver) were
actually inlaid into undercut grooves
in the steel much as a dentist would
fill a tooth, or the &ldquo;false&rdquo; damascene
in which the precious metal was
applied in the form of foil and
rubbed onto the steel surface which
had previously been roughened by
tool work to produce innumerable
tiny sharp points which could be
burnished down to hold the foil
firmly in place.</p>

finely decorated suits of armor for the nobles of the court of Queen
Elizabeth. This gauntlet is a magnificent specimen of engineering skill as
applied to the design of armor; its construction allows complete freedom
to the wrist, knuckle, and finger joints, yet keeps the hand perfectly protected
in any position. The gauntlet is decorated with an etched design of
rising eagles in interlaced medallions against a dotted background; the
latter is partly black, partly gilded.</p>

<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">LATE ARMOR</span></h2>
<p>As the sixteenth century drew to a close armor began to deteriorate.
No single influence was responsible. Do not think that firearms were invented
and armor was therefore suddenly made obsolete. As a matter of
fact, firearms were in use before plate armor really received general acceptance,
and firearms were in use all the time that plate armor was being worn
in Europe. But the gradual improvement in the efficiency of firearms undoubtedly
caused armor to be made heavier and heavier, and thereby
contributed greatly to its decline. For just when armor was thus increasing
in weight there developed a new school of cavalry tactics based upon the
use of lightly armed troopers on fast horses who, instead of directly attacking
the enemy, could dash around his flank and cut off his supplies from the
rear. The tendency was, therefore, to make the armor light and very
flexible, directly contrary to the need for solid, bullet-stopping protection.
Even fashion had a deteriorating effect on armor. <a href="#fig20">Fig. 20</a> shows a late suit
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
of armor which has a multitude of small plates to give extreme flexibility,
and has extra wide leg protectors to cover the extravagant wide-topped
trousers which were then the vogue. But what a clumsy suit this is compared
to the Maximilian suit of <a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>!</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Fig. 20. &ldquo;Three-quarter&rdquo; suit of armor for

</div>
<p>During the seventeenth century armor shrank away piece by piece,
much as a tired soldier might have been tempted to discard it on a long
march. The choking face defenses vanished from the helmet. The sollerets
went, then the shin guards or <i>greaves</i>, then the thigh guards. The arm
guards were discarded, then the gauntlets. Finally the armored man was
left with only breastplate, backplate, and helmet, and even these deteriorated
in the following century into the decorative but inefficient trappings
of the cuirassier. The two world wars, with their steel helmets and flak
suits (the design of which was strongly influenced by ancient models) have
revived the use of armor, but it is a machine-made product and, well-designed
though it be, must be considered a reproduction rather than an
original work of art.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">QUESTIONS CONCERNING ARMOR</span></h2>
<p>Let us turn back to the armor of the fifteenth and early sixteenth
centuries, and consider some of the questions which naturally arise in our
minds as we contemplate these relics of the past. In the first place, was it
practical? How could men possibly wear such a mass of metal upon their
bodies and engage in long military campaigns, interspersed with violent
battles? Isn&rsquo;t it true that an armored man, once fallen, could not get up
again until he was hoisted with a derrick? No, that isn&rsquo;t true. The comical
scenes in the moving pictures of frustrated knights floundering about in
search of hoisting engines were put in strictly for laughs. Armor was practical;
it was worn by about all the most important men of more than three
centuries; if they had not worn it they would not have lived long enough
to become important! As a matter of fact armor is not as heavy as one
might think. A good military suit weighs no more than the pack carried
by a modern soldier, sixty pounds or less, and is a great deal more comfortable
to carry. The pack hangs from the shoulders, but a good suit of armor,
carefully made (as all good armor had to be made) to fit the individual body
of the wearer, has its weight distributed over the entire body. The helmet
rests partly on the head and partly on the shoulders. The breast and backplates
rest partly on the shoulders and partly on the hips. The arm and leg
guards are laced to the special undergarment which had always to be
worn with armor, and each limb supports its own protection. The joints
come at exactly the right places to correspond with the natural motions
of the body, and every one of these motions is provided for. A man wearing
a properly fitting suit of armor over the correct undergarment could do
anything that a modern man can do wearing a winter overcoat, and probably,
due to his special training, a number of things that the modern man
could not. He could certainly walk, run, climb a wall, lie down and get up
quickly, and mount his horse without help. To test the truth of these
statements and the implications of the romantic novels of the past, the
writer donned a suit of armor which fitted him only approximately, yet
found himself able to perform all the actions above mentioned and, in addition,
to descend two stories on a rope, hand under hand.</p>
<p>Two particular devices aided in making such flexibility possible. Where
the body needed protection combined with motility it could be covered
with a series of narrow, overlapping steel strips, each of which was riveted
in turn to one or more leather straps, the ends of which were fastened to
the solid main defense. Then as the body was flexed the steel strips or
<i>lames</i> would slide over one another without exposing the body beneath
them (<a href="#fig21">Fig. 21</a>). It was also possible to join a series of lames by not more
than two rivets for each pair; these would act as pivots, allowing one
lame to rotate slightly relative to the other (<a href="#fig22">Fig. 22</a>). However, if rivets
were used with rather large heads with a washer under the burred end of
each, and if the holes for the rivet in one lame were round while that in the
other had the form of a slot, in addition to the pivoting motion, a certain
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
amount of sideways motion between the lames would be possible (<a href="#fig23">Fig. 23</a>).</p>

<p>Who wore armor? Every man who could afford it. Armor was always
very much of a luxury. Its making required the services of consummate
craftsmen, men who were not only expert metal workers, but also skilled
draughtsmen, expert tailors, and keen students of human anatomy. Armorers
were the aristocrats of all mediaeval craftsmen, the most highly
respected and by far the best paid. It required a great deal of their time;
the completion of a full suit of armor might take a year or more. Armor
was, therefore, in the class of the modern automobile. A wealthy monarch
might have a large wardrobe of beautifully decorated armor, as a millionaire
to-day owns a fleet of expensive imported motor cars. A simple knight
would be proud to possess a single suit, plain, but nevertheless made exactly
to fit him and no other person. A minor soldier was lucky if he could
secure a simple ready-made breastplate and helmet.</p>
<p>What was the physical character of the men who wore armor? Why do
the suits seem so small? Were people smaller in those days? Yes and no.
It is true that the nature of their life tended to develop men of the cowboy
type, wiry rather than massive. Men who spend their lives on horseback
are likely to have a broad shoulder and narrow waist, strong thigh and
slender calf. It is true too that with primitive medicine and sanitation man
died young; the average age of adult males was less than it is now.</p>
<p>However the principal reason for the small average size of preserved
suits of armor lies in its inextensibility. A suit of armor cannot be &ldquo;let out&rdquo;.
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
As has been pointed out, it had to be made exactly to fit the wearer. Men
had to learn their military duties very young, they had to have and to
wear armor while they were still growing. Consequently they usually outgrew
their first suit of armor, and it was this suit, unmarked by the scars
of serious fighting, which was most likely to be preserved. By the time a man
reached his full growth his armor showed wear and tear; when he died he
was buried in it, or it was discarded after his death as too battered to be
worth keeping. The suits of armor in the world&rsquo;s collections are largely the
outgrown suits of young men.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">MIDDLE EASTERN ARMOR</span></h2>
<p>In addition to the armor of Europe, consideration should be given to
that of the Middle East, of which the City Art Museum displays a number
of fine specimens in a special gallery. Armor was worn in Persia and in
India long after it had been abandoned in Europe; it is even possible that
among isolated tribes armorers may still be plying their trade. However,
as in Europe, the later work tended to deteriorate, and the earlier an Eastern
armor is, the better will it probably be.</p>
<p>The Indian and Persian smiths had two specialties: Damascus steel
and damascened steel, which are often and not unnaturally confused, both
having presumably originated at Damascus. Damascene work has already
been described on <a href="#Page_15">page 15</a>; both
the &ldquo;true&rdquo; and the &ldquo;false&rdquo; variety
were practised throughout the
Middle East. Damascus steel, on
the other hand, is a type of
metal especially suitable for armor
and sword blades, made by
the intimate combination, in innumerable
layers, of two kinds
of metal, one extremely hard, the
other soft and tough. As billets of
this composite steel were twisted,
bent, and reformed, the superimposed
layers made intricate
patterns like those in watered
silk. Such Damascus steel patterns
can be best observed in
sword and dagger blades like
those illustrated in <a href="#fig35">Fig. 35</a>,
<a href="#Page_29">page 29</a>.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig24">
<img src="images/p13.jpg" alt="" width="472" height="600" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Fig. 24. This is the breastplate of a Persian suit of armor. The buckles
are for the straps which attach the side and back plates.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The Persian armorers did not follow the European custom of
forging body armor exactly to fit the wearer, but instead made the
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
principal defense of four rectangular plates known as <i>char aina</i> or &ldquo;the four
mirrors&rdquo;. Two were worn as breast- and backplate respectively, the other
two, made concave on the upper edge, were worn at the sides, the concavity
fitting under the arm. Chain mail was always used in the East, even more
extensively than in Europe, to protect all areas of the body not covered by
the char aina or other defenses of solid plate. <a href="#fig24">Fig. 24</a> shows a plate of such a
four-piece armor. It is made of fine Damascus steel (the pattern is too fine
to show in the photograph), and is decorated with damascene inlay of floral
arabesques in gold. This is work of the late sixteenth or early seventeenth
century, and combines adequate functionality with oriental elegance. A
Persian helmet (<a href="#fig25">Fig. 25</a>) of the same period shows skillful forging of the
fluted ornament.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig25">
<img src="images/p13a.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="582" />

</div>
<p>But the helmet in <a href="#fig26">Fig. 26</a>, probably a century or more earlier, shows a
much greater appreciation of sculptural form. With a row of parallel vertical
flutings around its domed upper part, it resembles closely the Maximilian
armor of contemporary Europe. It is doubtful, however, if many European
smiths could have forged the minaret-like pinnacle which terminates the
dome. The helmet is decorated with damascene work of silver in calligraphic
inscriptions and arabesques. Its owner&rsquo;s neck was protected by chain mail
attached around the lower edge of the helmet. Probably because of the
warmer climate, the Saracenic warriors never adopted the closed helmet
of European lands, but preferred to leave the face exposed, or protected
only by a nasal bar which was often so arranged that it could be slid upwards
and clamped.</p>

<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">ARMS: STRIKING AND CUTTING WEAPONS</span></h2>
<p>Man&rsquo;s first weapon was probably a club, and the simple club has always
retained a certain popularity. Even in the middle of the sixteenth century,
when arms of all kinds attained great elaboration, the mace, or short one-handed
club, was the accepted weapon of military men in holy orders who,
forbidden to shed blood, found no such prohibition against the bloodless
cracking of skulls. <a href="#fig27">Fig. 27</a> shows such a mace, of heavy steel, carved and
gilded, a formidable though beautiful weapon. Related arms are short-handled
military axes and hammers.</p>
<p>But the accepted symbol of man as a fighting creature has always been
the sword, and the sword, perhaps more than any other item of man&rsquo;s
warlike panoply, has experienced the full range of his artistic and technical
initiative. Space does not here permit a discussion of the innumerable types
of swords; only a brief resum&eacute; of the general development can be given.
This is supplemented by a display of some typical forms along one side wall
of the armor gallery.</p>

</div>
<p>Stone Age man could not make any true swords, for the flint and obsidian
which he had to use were too brittle to be available in large pieces.
But bronze could be cast into swords both effective and beautiful. A number
of Chinese bronze sword blades from the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-220
A.D.) (<a href="#fig28">Fig. 28</a>) are available in the study collection. They are rather short,
double edged blades, adapted primarily for thrusting, but not without
cutting ability too. The Greeks and Romans used swords of rather similar
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
form, and also another type which tended to broaden near the point, bringing
the weight forward and adding impetus to both the thrust and the cut.</p>
<p>Mention has already been made, (<a href="#Page_4">p. 4</a>), of the rare but beautiful
swords of the dark ages, made in whole or in part of laminated metal
resembling the Damascus steel of the Middle East, (cf. <a href="#Page_20">p. 20</a>). Such swords
were carried by the Vikings who harried the coast of Britain and extended
their voyages even to North America. These swords had long, straight,
symmetrically double-edged blades, a short hilt, and a short crossbar
guard between blade and hilt. They were very powerful in a downward
slash, but too heavy to be manipulated easily as thrusting weapons.</p>
<p>By the fifteenth century the crossbar and the hilt had become longer,
giving the weapon a better balance, but the general character of the arm
remained the same. With the longer hilt, both hands could be used, considerably
increasing the power of the weapon (<a href="#fig29">Fig. 29</a> [1], also <a href="#imgx2">title page</a>
illustration). This tendency continued in the sixteenth century until it
culminated in the enormous two-handed swords used by the professional
mercenary soldiers, or <i>landesknechts</i> (<a href="#fig29">Fig. 29</a> [2]). Such swords were over
five feet long, with immense drooping guards and long leather-wrapped
hilts.</p>

</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p15a.jpg" alt="Court sword hilt" width="500" height="548" />
</div>
<p>As the sixteenth century advanced, sword blades became narrower,
lighter, and more adapted for thrusting, while guards developed rings and
curved knuckle-guards to protect the out-thrust hand (<a href="#fig29">Fig. 29</a> [4], [3]). The
new method of fighting had definite advantages over the old slashing
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
system, which required the sword to be raised high, exposing the body,
before a blow could be struck, and soon the thrusting sword, or <i>rapier</i>, was
used everywhere. The system of rings which formed the guard grew more
complicated and finally coalesced into a solid metal cup, which completely
shielded the hand within it (<a href="#fig29">Fig. 29</a> [6], [8]). Sometimes a dagger (<a href="#fig29">Fig. 29</a>
[5], [7]) was held in the left hand to parry the opponent&rsquo;s sword blade,
but eventually this was abandoned and fencers learned to parry with the
rear portion of their own blades, before making a second thrust (<i>riposte</i>)
with the point. Action grew faster and faster, and swords lighter and more
manageable, until by the seventeenth century the customary weapon was
the <i>court sword</i>, with a short, single-handed hilt, a small flat guard often
magnificently decorated in chiselled steel, and a relatively short, light
blade having a needle-like point, and often without any sharp cutting
edge at all (<a href="#fig30">Fig. 30</a>).</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>In addition to the sword, the dagger was often used as a supplementary
weapon which could still be carried for self-protection when courtesy or
convenience made the wearing of a sword impracticable. Daggers were
made in a number of special shapes, varying with changes of fashion. In
the fifteenth century two popular forms were the <i>rondel dagger</i> (<a href="#fig31">Fig. 31</a>)
which had guard and pommel in the form of disks, and the <i>kidney dagger</i>
(then known by a less-printable name and worn, with the naive exhibitionism
of pre-Victorian days, directly below the belt buckle) which had a
straight, simple hilt and a short guard of ball-like form. Italians of the
sixteenth century liked the <i>anelace</i>, with its drooping guard and short, wide,
sharply tapering blade. Mention has already been made of the left-hand
daggers of the seventeenth century. The <i>stiletto</i>, without a guard other
than a short cross-bar, was also popular at this time. Hunters and landesknechts
often carried a complete outfit of small tools in the scabbard with
their dagger; such a <i>trousse</i> (<a href="#fig32">Fig. 32</a>) was very convenient when preparing
freshly-killed venison for the cook or when eating around a camp fire.</p>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">LANCES AND POLE ARMS</span></h2>
<p>The chief arm of the mounted knight was the lance, a weapon having
a long and often quite heavy wooden shaft and a steel point. Near the butt
its diameter was reduced to provide a comfortable hand grip, and just in
front of this grip there was applied a <i>vamplate</i> or conical hand guard of
steel. Behind the grip there was attached a thick iron ring called a <i>graper</i>,
which, when the lance was in use, rested against the hook or lance-rest projecting
from the right side of the knight&rsquo;s breastplate. The graper thus
served as a thrust bearing, and put directly behind the point of the lance
the entire momentum of horse and rider. When such a projectile made a
direct hit upon an opponent something had to give. Either the opponent
was knocked completely off his horse, or his back was broken, or the lance
was shattered.</p>
<p>Foot soldiers also employed arms with long wooden shafts, of which
by far the commonest was the <i>pike</i>, which had a very simple steel point
and butt ferrule respectively on the ends of a slender rod of wood about
fourteen feet long. This was the arm of the great bodies of mercenary
infantry which did so much of the fighting of the seventeenth century. A
company of such men, formed into a square or circle, the front rank kneeling,
the second standing, and both holding their pikes with the butts against
the ground and the points projecting outward, was almost invulnerable to
cavalry, whose horses would not charge against the forest of pike-points.
The one effective maneuver against them was for some of the cavalry to
dismount and attack swinging great two-handed swords, which could beat
down the pike points and allow the cavalry to ride in.</p>
<p>Lance and pike were simple utilitarian tools; few have survived. But
there are other pole arms, from the fifteenth century on, which offered
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
more opportunity to individual taste in form and decoration; a number
of these are present in the Museum&rsquo;s collection. Some (<a href="#fig33">Fig. 33</a>) were developments
of the simple spear point, as for example (1) the type called an
<i>ox-tongue</i> or (2) a boar spear provided with a toggle to prevent a wounded
animal from charging right up the shaft of the weapon which transfixed
him. In (3), now a well-developed <i>partisan</i>, the toggle has been replaced
by a projecting spur at each side of the base. In (4) these spurs have become
large and ornamental, the weapon is decorated with etching, and has become
a ceremonial object rather than a weapon for actual fighting. (5) is
a partisan of the state guard of Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony
and King of Poland (1697-1733), and is even more noticeably designed for
display purposes only.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Fig. 33. Spear-type pole arms, XV-XVII centuries.

</div>
<p>Other pole arms are developments of the axe. Military axes (<a href="#fig34">Fig. 34</a> [1],
[2]) had handles somewhat shorter than those of pikes, spears or partisans
but longer than the short-handled axes used on horseback. They were
particularly popular for use in judicial combats or &ldquo;trial by battle&rdquo;. Each
contestant in a law suit would swear to the truth of his claim, and call upon
God to prove its truth. The two men, armed with such axes, would fight
until one was killed or driven out of the ring. The victor was thus proven
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
to have told the truth, while the unsuccessful contestant, if still alive, was
executed for perjury. Such axes, capable of defending the right, were made
with special care, and were highly valued by their surviving owners.</p>

</div>
<p>Axes with longer shafts were known as <i>halberds</i>, and were usually provided
with a sharpened hook at the back of the axe blade to permit a man
on foot to catch and cut the bridle rein of an attacking horseman. Like
the partisans, halberds developed from plain functional military types,
(<a href="#fig34">Fig. 34</a> [3], [4]) of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries respectively to
highly decorated types carried as badges of authority by the state guards
of Christian II of Saxony (<a href="#fig34">Fig. 34</a> [5]) and of the Princes of Liechtenstein
(<a href="#fig34">Fig. 34</a> [6]) respectively.</p>

<p>Ever since a hairy primitive first picked up a stone and threw it, man
has tried to find better and better ways to strike from a safe distance. The
devices which he has produced for this purpose have been many and varied,
yet, strangely enough, remarkable similarities often occur between inventions
of widely separated areas. In ancient Peruvian graves have been
found cord slings for hurling stones almost identical with those used by
herd boys in Palestine today, as in the time of David and Goliath. Bronze
arrowheads from prehistoric Japan are much the same as those excavated
from Roman Britain. The bow has several different characteristic forms
distributed throughout the world, but its fundamental principle is everywhere
the same.</p>

<p>The first projectile-throwing arm appropriate to an art museum is the
crossbow, which is simply a bow mounted on a wooden stock provided with
a catch and trigger, so that the bow could be carried ready to shoot. This
was a great convenience in hunting or war, because otherwise the time lost
in drawing the bow might give the victim opportunity to escape. Moreover,
it was soon found that the application of mechanical devices permitted
the use of a bow much stronger than any man could draw unaided.</p>

<p><a href="#fig37">Fig. 37</a> shows a light Flemish crossbow of the fifteenth century. Its
wooden stock is inlaid with white and with green stained bone in openwork
patterns. This type of crossbow required mechanical assistance to pull the
string back to the catch which would hold it until the moment should
arrive to shoot; the instrument employed was called a <i>goat&rsquo;s foot</i> lever.</p>
<p>The crossbow of <a href="#fig38">Fig. 38</a> is Italian work of the sixteenth century. The
bow is light enough to be pulled by the hands alone, without mechanical
assistance. It had a double string, with a little pouch attached between
the two strands, and shot small bullets, instead of arrows. The wooden
stock is beautifully carved and the metal parts are damascened with arabesques
in gold. This type of light crossbow was especially popular with
aristocratic ladies who are frequently represented shooting it in hunting
tapestries of the period.</p>
<p>In <a href="#fig39">Fig. 39</a> is shown a very powerful hunting crossbow of the seventeenth
century. The bow is of steel, two inches wide and a third of an inch
thick. The bowstring resembles a piece of heavy rope. To pull this string,
bending a steel spring as massive as this, requires a tremendous power and
an immense strength in the mechanism which will hold the fully-drawn
bow until the moment for its release.</p>
<p>The pulling power is supplied by a device, also shown in the illustration
(<a href="#fig39">Fig. 39</a>) called a <i>cranequin</i> or <i>cric</i>. It is in mechanical respects essentially
identical with a modern geared automobile jack, although, of course,
it pulls instead of lifts (<a href="#fig40">Fig. 40</a>). A force of fifty pounds applied to the handle
generates on the claw which grasps the bowstring a pull of more than two
tons! <a href="#fig41">Fig. 41</a> shows the mechanism for holding and releasing the string.
(These parts are, of course, normally invisible, being hidden inside the
wooden stock).</p>
<p>Returning to the artistic aspects of the crossbow of <a href="#fig39">Fig. 39</a>, we observe
that the whole of the wooden stock is inlaid with plates of white stag horn
engraved with scenes illustrating the legend of William Tell&mdash;certainly
an appropriate decoration! The bow is quite plain except for the addition
of decorative pompoms of colored wool, but the cranequin gear housing is
elaborately etched with representations of Biblical and mythological personages,
strapwork, and interlace, much of this unfortunately now worn
away.</p>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">PROJECTILE WEAPONS: FIREARMS</span></h2>
<p>The study of antique firearms is a fascinating one. Contrary to usual
belief, firearms are not a late invention. They were in use before complete
suits of plate armor were made, and continued in use throughout the entire
period that plate armor was worn. Many thousands of different specimens
have been classified, but all firearms before the nineteenth century belong
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
to one of four types. These include
(1) the cannon or hand cannon in
which the charge of gunpowder was
set off by direct application of a
burning slow match or hot iron held
by the shooter; (2) the matchlock
in which burning slow match or
tinder was held in a clamp attached
to the gun and was brought into
contact with the gunpowder by a
mechanism attached to the gun and
operated by the shooter; (3) the
wheellock in which fire was not
carried about, but was produced by
a mechanism like that of a modern
cigarette lighter: a rough wheel was
spun around in contact with a stone
(not flint, but a nodular form of iron
pyrite) so that sparks were produced
to set off the gunpowder; (4) the
flintlock and its variations, in which
a piece usually of flint stone held in a
clamp attached to a strong spring
was moved by the spring to strike a
piece of steel, and thereby generate
the spark which would set fire to the gunpowder. The Museum&rsquo;s collection
includes interesting and unusual specimens of all but the first of these
types.</p>

<p>The earliest, simplest form of hand firearm, the hand cannon of the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, is also the least interesting esthetically.
Consisting of a simple tube of iron, it was usually crudely formed, and quite
undecorated. Such hand cannon have much archaeological interest, but
contribute nothing to the history of art. The first step forward in the
mechanization of firearms was the matchlock, and matchlock guns also
were usually crude and strictly utilitarian, military pieces (<a href="#fig42">Fig. 42</a>). However,
a few specimens of fine quality were made for important personages,
and the Museum is fortunate in possessing precisely such a specimen
(<a href="#fig43">Fig. 43</a>), the gift of the John M. Olin Trust. The exact date and place of its
manufacture are uncertain; it could be English but seems a bit more likely
to be Dutch, toward the middle of the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>The lock is the standard seventeenth century matchlock, with the
earlier form of trigger resembling that of a crossbow. The serpentine which
holds the burning slow match moves upon pressure of the trigger in the
rearward direction, from the muzzle towards the butt, bringing the burning
slow match (a piece of rope impregnated with saltpeter) into contact
with the powder pan, the swiveling cover of which must first have been
opened by hand. After the slow match has ignited the priming powder and
fired the piece, a release of pressure on the trigger allows a return spring
to force the serpentine back to its original position. Notice the shape of
the serpentine, suggesting not so much a snake as a double-headed dragon.</p>

<p>The barrel is one-third octagon with finely forged cross mouldings at
the change of shape as well as at breach and muzzle. The rear sight is a
steel tube, beautifully formed in partly octagonal, partly fluted and molded
sections. A flash guard extends from the pan to this rear sight to protect
the shooter&rsquo;s eyes against particles of burning powder from the pan.</p>
<p>It is the stock, however, which is the most remarkable feature of the
gun. This is of dark brown wood, completely covered with an elaborate
inlay of brass wire and engraved mother-of-pearl in a design of floral
scrolls issuing from vases and supporting birds and insects. A few escutcheons
are inlaid in engraved bone or white stag horn. The elaborateness
of this inlay, combined with its delicacy and taste, make this one of the
outstanding matchlock guns of the world.</p>
<p>The wheellock, which for the first time freed gunners from the necessity
of carrying around with them a continuously burning coil of slow match,
was invented in the early years of the sixteenth century and retained its
popularity, in Germany at least, until the very end of the eighteenth. It
thus has had a longer period of use than any other firearm with a discharge
mechanism. The Museum&rsquo;s earliest wheellock, from about 1550 (<a href="#fig44">Fig. 44</a>),
has its entire octagonal barrel and lock magnificently decorated with damascene
of floral arabesques in gold and silver. The stock is inlaid with engraved
stag horn showing hunting scenes, Hercules&rsquo; capture of Iole (whose
hand he had won by conquering her father, Eurytus, in a shooting match),
and the figures of Alexander the Great and &ldquo;Der Nero&rdquo;. This gun well
illustrates the close relationship which, in this day, existed between the
various arts, for these inlaid designs are copied almost exactly from a
series of engravings by Hans Sebald Beham (1500-<i>ca.</i> 1550), examples of
which are in the City Art Museum&rsquo;s print collection (<a href="#fig45">Fig. 45</a>).</p>
<p>Another, rifled, specimen, from about 1635, formerly in the Liechtenstein
collection (<a href="#fig46">Fig. 46</a> [2]) has a plain barrel, but the lock is finely engraved
with a hunting scene, while the stock (<a href="#fig47">Fig. 47</a> [2]) is most elaborately inlaid
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
with fine filigrees and engraved plates of stag horn representing mythological
characters, animals, and monsters against an architectural and arabesque
background. The stock bears the mark of Martin S&uuml;ssebecker,
who was born at Liegnitz in 1593, and died in 1668 at Dresden where he
was gunmaker to the court of the Electors of Saxony.</p>
<p>A light hunting rifle (<a href="#fig46">Fig. 46</a> [3]) with a very short stock of the type
known as <i>tschinke</i> from the fact that such guns were made at the town of
Teschen in German Silesia, dates probably from the latter part of the
seventeenth century. It has a peculiar type of wheellock of which the mainspring
and most of the other mechanism are exposed on the outside of
the lock plate. The barrel is engraved. The lock is ornamented with openwork
carving, and the stock (<a href="#fig47">Fig. 47</a> [3]) is inlaid with mother-of-pearl and
engraved stag horn in various designs and animal motives against a background
of floral arabesques and scroll work.</p>
<p>A fine Italian wheellock pistol (<a href="#fig48">Fig. 48</a>) was formerly in the collection
of H. G. Keasbey. The barrel, ornamented with raised ridges giving it an
octagonal appearance, is inscribed &ldquo;Lazari Cominaz&rdquo;, an abbreviation of
the name of Lazarino Cominazzo, an early gunsmith of Brescia, in northern
Italy, whose work became so famous that the name was adopted by his
successors practically as a trademark. The simple but finely carved lock
and the lace-like openwork steel inlays of the stock are characteristic of
the best Brescian workmanship. The piece dates from about 1630.</p>
<p>But the finest wheellocks in the collection are a &ldquo;suite&rdquo; consisting of a
gun and pair of pistols (<a href="#fig46">Fig. 46</a> [4], [4<span class="smaller">A</span>], [4<span class="smaller">B</span>]). These three pieces differ
slightly from one another in their decoration, but they all bear the same
signature, &ldquo;Claude Thomas &agrave; Espinal 1623&rdquo;, and are otherwise so similar
that there is no doubt that they were intended to go together. All have
wheellocks elaborately ornamented with carving and engraving. The pear
wood stocks are magnificently carved in the round, in openwork, and in
relief, with plants, animals, and formal ornaments. They all bear a coat of
arms which has not yet been identified. On the pistols this is on the side of
the stock opposite the lock plate, but on the gun the coat of arms is relegated
to the left rear part of the stock, while the region opposite the lock
plate is ornamented with a medallion containing the initials &ldquo;C. T.&rdquo;. This,
together with the extraordinary elaboration of all three pieces, suggests that
this set of guns and pistols was not, as was usually the case, made to the
order of a wealthy client, but was rather a &ldquo;masterpiece&rdquo; produced by a
young gunmaker exhibiting all the skill of which he was capable to prove
his worthiness to attain the title of &ldquo;master gunsmith&rdquo; in the gunmakers&rsquo;
guild and the right to set up a shop of his own. The coat of arms is presumably
that of the noble patron who had supported him in the past and to
whom the pieces would eventually come, but as they were made for glory
and not for pay, the gunsmith felt quite entitled to place his own initials in a
prominent position. It should be noted that though the pistols are both
smooth-bored the gun is carefully rifled. It is interesting to speculate about
the fate of Claude Thomas. It seems improbable that so skilled a craftsman
should not have been successful in his career. Yet, this set of three
pieces is the only work of this master known up to the present time. Perhaps
he tried experimenting in mechanisms as he had already in decoration,
with the result that a magnificent technician was destroyed in the explosion
of his invention. Perhaps he succumbed to the plague or to the fortunes of
war. All we know is that he could and did make some of the most magnificent
guns in the world, and here they are!</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>A large and heavy gun (<a href="#fig46">Fig. 46</a> [1]) with a peculiar type of early flintlock
having an exposed mainspring and known as a <i>miguelet</i> was probably
made in Brescia for a purchaser from the Balearic Islands. The barrel is
plain; the lock (<a href="#fig47">Fig. 47</a> [1]) and steel mountings of the walnut stock, however,
are elaborately carved in openwork and in strong relief. Some of the
details of this carving, especially that on the trigger guard, evidence the
exquisite skill characteristic of the Brescian gunsmiths (compare the wheellock
pistol mentioned above). The general style of most of the carving,
however, shows a ruggedness of design and a love of the grotesque characteristic
of Balearic Island taste. The barrel is inscribed &ldquo;Lazari Cominaz&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Another early flintlock variation was the <i>snaphaunce</i>, a form in which
the piece of steel struck by the flint was not attached to the cover of the
pan holding the priming powder, but was entirely separate from it and
could be turned back out of the way as a safety precaution, when immediate
use of the arm was not expected. The Museum has a fine snaphaunce
pistol in the Brescian style.</p>
<p>Two other pairs of pistols with normal flintlocks are excellent examples
of Brescian work. One (<a href="#fig46">Fig. 46</a> [6]) from about 1640-1660 has barrels with
longitudinal ridging about one-third of their length and with the full inscription
&ldquo;Lazarino Cominazzo&rdquo;. The locks are lightly engraved to give
an impression of very shallow relief carving, and bear the signature of
&ldquo;Giovanni Bourgognone in Brescia&rdquo;. The walnut stocks are ornamented
with openwork steel similar to those on the wheellock pistol above described.
The other pair (<a href="#fig46">Fig. 46</a> [5]), possibly somewhat earlier, have barrels
octagonal for about one-sixth of their length. These bear the inscription
&ldquo;Lazaro Lazarino&rdquo; (presumably a son of the great Lazarino Cominazzo
or of one of his namesakes). The stocks are of walnut. The locks and the
large and numerous mounts on the stock are elaborately chiseled steel in
strong relief with designs of animals, monsters, and semi-human figures
against a background of floral arabesques.</p>
<p>Not all flintlocks were on firearms. The same mechanism was used on
tinder boxes, alarm clocks, and gunpowder testers. The powder tester
(<a href="#fig49">Fig. 49</a>) was like a pistol with a friction cover closing the mouth of the
barrel. It was loaded (of course without a bullet) and fired. The force of
the explosion blew the cover away from the barrel against the friction of a
heavy spring; the distance which it moved gave an index of the strength
of the gunpowder.</p>

<p><a href="#fig50">Fig. 50</a> illustrates a very complete outfit of pistols and accessories made
at Lisbon, Portugal, by Jacinto Xavier in 1799. There are a pair of double barreled
holster pistols for rides abroad, and a pair of small but deadly
pocket pistols for self defense or card table arguments. With these are the
accessories and tools appropriate to them: powder flask, powder measure,
bullet molds, oil can, hammer, screw driver, awl, (for cleaning the touch
holes), and box for spare flints and bullets. All are enclosed in a handsome
mahogany case.</p>
<p>The outfit is definitely that of a dandy, for every piece is beautifully
made and exquisitely decorated. The steel parts of the pistols are brilliantly
polished or deeply blued. The stocks are delicately inlaid with rococo scrolls
of silver wire. The oil can is a dainty hexagonal urn. Even the hammer and
screw driver deserve in their own right places in a museum display.</p>

</div>
<p>Students of the history of arms will delight in the holster pistols, for
these have each two barrels side by side, while a single flintlock fires each
in turn. The powder pan which catches the sparks from the flint is divided
into two parts: that on the right transmits the ignition directly to the right
hand barrel; that on the left is covered by a slide operated by a thumb
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
piece on the left side of the pistol. When this slide is pulled back, a second
priming charge is exposed, so that the lock may be snapped again to fire
the left hand barrel. Both barrels may be unscrewed by means of a wrench
attached to the bullet mold; they are loaded from the breach with a slightly
oversized bullet which will not move through the barrel until the pistols
are fired.</p>

</div>
<p>The little pocket pistols are a gadgeteer&rsquo;s dream. They have invisible
triggers, which are only exposed when the lock is cocked. Each has on the
right side a tiny triangular bayonet which springs into position at a touch
on a catch. On the left side is a strong, light, knife blade similarly operated.
Above each barrel is a second smaller knife blade (just right for trimming
a quill pen), which may be pushed forward from a housing which conceals
and protects it. And in the butt of each pistol is hidden a small but, effective
corkscrew. What more could Beau Brummel himself desire?</p>
<p>The final item for which we have space is a flintlock pistol (<a href="#fig51">Fig. 51</a>) of
the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century. It bears the signature
&ldquo;Derby &agrave; Paris&rdquo;. Nothing seems to be known of this gunmaker; whether
he was a Frenchman with an English name or an English gunsmith working
in France must be left for future research to determine. In any case, he
was a master of his craft. The pistol is in beautiful condition, though the
blue color of the metal is a later restoration, no doubt based on the original
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
finish of the weapon. The barrel and lock are finely engraved and partially
gilt; the walnut stock is fitted with a gilded butt cap and inlaid with silver
wire in delicate arabesque scrolls. Attached to the top of the barrel is a
short bayonet of bright steel; this is mounted with a spring device in such
a way that the bayonet can be folded back when not needed, but at a touch
of the thumb upon the spring catch, will fly forward and lock in position
for use.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Fig. 51. A repeating flintlock pistol. A thousand of these in
one place could have changed the history of the world!</i></p>
</div>
<p>The most remarkable feature of this pistol, however, is its ingenious
repeating mechanism. The type, though rare, is well known. It seems to
have been invented about one hundred years previous, toward the close
of the seventeenth century, by a Florentine gunsmith named Lorenzoni.
During the following hundred years it was extensively copied. Arms with
this type of mechanism are known bearing the signatures of Austrian,
German, French, English, and Spanish gunsmiths. Variations and improvements
show themselves from time to time, but a complete study of
the Lorenzoni type of flintlock repeater has yet to be written. Its general
principle, however, is as follows: a cylinder of brass, lying transversely
across the body of the pistol, can be rotated a half turn by a lever. As this
is done, the cylinder picks up a bullet, gunpowder, and priming powder,
and conveys them to the proper positions for firing. Lugs on the cylinder
also close the pan cover and cock the hammer. The magazines hold supplies
for eight shots, which can thus be fired with practically the speed of the
single action frontier revolver which was, for many years, the most famous
of American arms. Think what changes in history a liberal supply of
breech-loading repeating firearms of this type might have made had it
been available throughout the eighteenth century! But unfortunately very
few gunsmiths were skillful enough to do the precise work required on an
arm of this type, and all who ever lived would not have been able to make
enough of them to outfit a regiment. Such arms were rare and costly, and
only princes could afford them, but we are fortunate that this specimen
has come down to us to show what Master Derby of Paris could do generations
before the day of Colt, Winchester, and the all-destructive Atom.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
